# SAARTHI.AI-ASSIGNMENT
● Problem Statement:  Given assignment is designed to check your skills of deep learning frameworks compatibility, code
quality, basic software engineering, understanding of problem and discipline.
In the given task Goal is that with given text you need to extract all the labels I.e., action that needs to
be taken, action to be taken on which object and location where that object is present.


● Used NLP to tackel with the test data.
● cleaned the text data with the help of NLP
● Used Vectorization technique to convert text data into numerical vector form
● Then used machine learning to build models on the data set
● I have used KNN, RandomForestClassifier, Bagging Classifier and GradientBoosting Classifier algorithms.
